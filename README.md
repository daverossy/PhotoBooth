# PhotoBooth
PhotoBooth is a python based application for building a photobooth with the Raspberry Pi platform.

It uses the pygame module to overlay graphics over a live preview of the Pi Camera module using the picamera module and then subsequently take photos which are saved to a USB storage device.
